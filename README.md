# alexa-assistant

Implementation of the Google Assistant API for Alexa

# Deployment Steps

0. Prerequisites

    * To deploy this skill, you will need the following tools:
        * [ASK CLI](https://developer.amazon.com/en-US/docs/alexa/smapi/quick-start-alexa-skills-kit-command-line-interface.html)
        * [Docker](https://docs.docker.com/get-docker/)

    * Setup your Google environment by only following the [Google-related](https://github.com/tartanguru/alexa-assistant-instructions/blob/master/fresh_install.md#enable-google-assistant-api-) installation instructions, skipping all Amazon Alexa-related steps. Once completed, follow the below steps to get a Google Maps API key:
        * Enable the [Google Maps Geocoding API](https://console.cloud.google.com/apis/library/geocoding-backend.googleapis.com) under the same project.
        * Create a new [API key credential](https://console.cloud.google.com/apis/credentials) and edit it:
            * Change name to `alexa_google_assistant`
            * Leave application restrictions to none
            * Set API restrictions to the Geocoding API only.

    * If upgrading from v2:
        * Create ask directory and states file adding the skill id listed under your [Alexa developer console](https://developer.amazon.com/alexa/console/ask). This will prevent duplicate skills from being created under your account.
        ```
        $ cat .ask/ask-states.json
        {
          "askcliStatesVersion": "2020-03-31",
          "profiles": {
            "default": {
              "skillId": "<skillId>"
            }
          }
        }
        ```
      * Remove your existing cloudformation stack

    * If your default language isn't English (US):
        * Configure your [AWS region](https://developer.amazon.com/en-US/docs/alexa/smarthome/develop-smart-home-skills-in-multiple-languages.html#deploy) to deploy to in [`ask-resources.json`](ask-resources.json).
        * Add your specific skill locale:
        ```
        $ ask skill add-locales
        ? Please select at least one locale to add: en-GB

        The following skill locale(s) have been added according to your local project:
          Added locale en-GB.json from en-US's interactionModel
        Please check the added files above, and run "ask deploy" to deploy the changes.
        ```

    * Configure your Google Project ID  `GoogleProjectId` and Google Maps API key `GoogleMapsApiKey` in [`ask-resources.json`](ask-resources.json) by setting the skill infrastructure cloudformation user config parameters. To enable debug logs, configure `LambdaDebug` to `true`.

    * Configure your Google Assistant API `clientId` and `clientSecret` in [`skill-package/accountLinking.json`](skill-package/accountLinking.json)

1. Deploy the skill and the lambda function in one step:
    ```
    $ ask deploy
    Deploy configuration loaded from ask-resources.json
    Deploy project for profile [default]

    ==================== Deploy Skill Metadata ====================
    Skill package deployed successfully.
    Skill ID: <skillId>

    ==================== Build Skill Code ====================
    Skill code built successfully.
    Code for region default built to <skillPath>/.ask/lambda/build.zip successfully with build flow CustomBuildFlow.

    ==================== Deploy Skill Infrastructure ====================
    âœ” Deploy Alexa skill infrastructure for region "default"
    The api endpoints of skill.json have been updated from the skill infrastructure deploy results.
    Skill infrastructures deployed successfully through @ask-cli/cfn-deployer.

    ==================== Enable Skill ====================
    Skill is enabled successfully.
    ```

2. Setup skill account linking using the skill id displayed in previous step and your OAuth2 provider configuration:
    ```
    $ ask smapi update-account-linking-info -s <skillId> --account-linking-request file:skill-package/accountLinking.json

    Command executed successfully!
    ```

3. Enable skill with account linking:
    * Go to your [Alexa skill console](https://alexa.amazon.com/spa/index.html#skills/your-skills/?ref-suffix=ysa_gw)
    * Click on the "Google Assistant" skill under the "Dev Skills" tab
    * Click "Enable", activate the "Device Country and Postal Code" permission and go through the account linking process
