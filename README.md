# Deployment Steps

0. Prerequisites

    * To deploy this skill, you will need the following tools:
        * [ASK CLI](https://developer.amazon.com/en-US/docs/alexa/smapi/quick-start-alexa-skills-kit-command-line-interface.html)
        * [Docker](https://docs.docker.com/get-docker/) (Optional to build Lambda dependencies locally)

    * To determine your Google OAuth2 client authorized redirect URIs, add your [Alexa Vendor ID](https://developer.amazon.com/settings/console/mycid) to the links below:
        * `https://layla.amazon.com/api/skill/link/<vendorId>`
        * `https://pitangui.amazon.com/api/skill/link/<vendorId>`
        * `https://alexa.amazon.co.jp/api/skill/link/<vendorId>`

    * Setup your Google environment by following the [Google-related](https://github.com/jsetton/alexa-assistant-instructions/blob/main/fresh_install.md#enable-google-assistant-api-) installation instructions only, skipping all Amazon-related steps, and taking note of the [Project ID](https://console.cloud.google.com/cloud-resource-manager) that was created. Once completed, create your Google Maps API key as follow:
        * Enable the [Google Maps Geocoding API](https://console.cloud.google.com/apis/library/geocoding-backend.googleapis.com) under the same project.
        * Enable the [billing](https://console.cloud.google.com/project/_/billing/enable) for the project. (Usage should be covered by monthly free tier credit)
        * Create a new [API key credential](https://console.cloud.google.com/apis/credentials) and edit it:
            * Change name to `google_assistant`
            * Leave application restrictions to none
            * Set API restrictions to the Geocoding API only.

    * Configure your `GoogleProjectId` and `GoogleMapsApiKey` in [`ask-resources.json`](ask-resources.json). To enable debug logs, add `LambdaDebug` set to `true` in the skill infrastructure cloudformation user config parameters.

    * Configure your Google Assistant API `clientId` and `clientSecret` in [`accountLinking.json`](accountLinking.json)

    * If your default language isn't English (US):
        * Configure your deploy `awsRegion` in [`ask-resources.json`](ask-resources.json) based on the table below:

            | Skill Language | Endpoint Region | Deploy Region |
            |:--------------:|:---------------:|:-------------:|
            | English (CA), English (US), French (CA),<br>Portuguese (BR), Spanish (MX) | North America | `us-east-1` |
            | English (UK), French (FR), German,<br>Italian, Spanish (ES) | Europe | `eu-west-1` |
            | English (IN) | India | `eu-west-1` |
            | English (AU), Japanese | Far East | `us-west-2` |

    * If upgrading from v2:
        * Create ask hidden directory and states file adding the Skill ID listed under your [Alexa developer console](https://developer.amazon.com/alexa/console/ask). This will prevent duplicate skills from being created under your account.
            ```
            $ cat .ask/ask-states.json
            {
              "askcliStatesVersion": "2020-03-31",
              "profiles": {
                "default": {
                  "skillId": "<skillId>"
                }
              }
            }
            ```
        * Delete your existing `AlexaAssistant` CloudFormation stack under your [AWS console](https://console.aws.amazon.com/cloudformation/home).

    * If deploying from a Windows environment:
        * Allow the build script to be executed by setting the current user [PowerShell execution policy](https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?LinkID=135170) to `RemoteSigned`.
            ```
            Set-ExecutionPolicy -ExecutionPolicy RemoteSigned -Scope CurrentUser
            ```

1. Deploy the skill and the lambda function in one step:
    ```
    $ ask deploy
    Deploy configuration loaded from ask-resources.json
    Deploy project for profile [default]

    ==================== Deploy Skill Metadata ====================
    Skill package deployed successfully.
    Skill ID: <skillId>

    ==================== Build Skill Code ====================
    Skill code built successfully.
    Code for region default built to <skillPath>/.ask/lambda/build.zip successfully with build flow CustomBuildFlow.

    ==================== Deploy Skill Infrastructure ====================
    âœ” Deploy Alexa skill infrastructure for region "default"
    The api endpoints of skill.json have been updated from the skill infrastructure deploy results.
    Skill infrastructures deployed successfully through @ask-cli/cfn-deployer.

    ==================== Enable Skill ====================
    Skill is enabled successfully.
    ```

2. Update the skill account linking information using the Skill ID displayed in previous step:
    ```
    $ ask smapi update-account-linking-info -s <skillId> --account-linking-request file:accountLinking.json

    Command executed successfully!
    ```

3. Enable the skill on your Alexa account:
    * Go to your Alexa app > More > Skills & Games.
    * Select the "Google Assistant" skill under Your Skills > Dev tab.
    * Tap "Enable to Use", go through the account linking process and grant the "Device Country and Postal Code" permission.
